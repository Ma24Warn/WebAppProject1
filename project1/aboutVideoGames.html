                        <span class="firstSent">The history of video games</span> dates all the way back to the mid 20th century. During this time, scientists were just beginning to 
                        experiment with electronic machines in order to create very simple games. This era was the birth of video games. There was a time during the 70s where a bunch of 
                        simple computer games were released to the public, but this failed to take off due to various reasons. In the year 1972, a man named Ralph Baer came up with the 
                        idea of a video game entertainment device that could be hooked up to the TV at your own home. With this idea came the Magnavox Odyssey, the worlds first at home 
                        video game console. This was the birth of video games outside of the arcades. From this point onwards, video games and the consoles which they are played on were 
                        constantly improving and breaking new grounds. These improvments have brought us to the video games and gaming devices which we know today, and they are still even 
                        improving. This current moment is only a small era in what will be the legacy of video games.

                    <span class="firstSent">The future of video games</span> is very promising considering the success of the industry. With constantly growing popularity, the gaming world is sure to see 
                    plenty more content as well as many improvment. Similar to all technology, video game software and hardware are constantly improving, allowing for even more impressive games as time goes on. 
                    Another major change in the industry in recent years has been the development of virtual reality. Due to the fact that it is still in its youth, VR technology is still quite expensive, making 
                    it harder to become mainstream in the gaming community. While this may currently be the case, with enough time VR will surely find its way into the mainstream.

                        <span class="firstSent">What I love about video games</span> is that they are a great way to relax and forget about the stresses of your everday life. Whereas some people enjoy spending their 
                        free time watching sports or reading, playing video games is just another way to pass the time for most people. I also enjoy playing video games because it is a way for me to connect with my 
                        friends who have moved further away for college. One of my best friends is also in the Navy, and has been stationed in Guam for the past few years. Video games have been a great way for me to 
                        stay in touch with him and also have fun together. I feel as if the social aspect is the one aspect of video games that never gets enough positive attention. Similar to how many people can stay 
                        in touch through social media despite not seeing each other in person, video games can also fill this same role. Video games are just a great way to escape and get invested in something that you 
                        can only see in a fictional world.
