                Computers have been around for many years now, and it is only recently that we have begun dedicated these devices to be the best at running video games.
                 While not necessarily a console, a gaming pc has much more range in all aspects because of it ability to be customized by the player. Gaming pc's can run 
                from very cheap to absurdly expensive, but it should be noted that these prices almost always correlate with the quality of the gaming computer.

            could be combine together to make a single regular controller was a groundbreaking feature that no other console had done before. To top that off, the Switch was not only a console which you could play games on your TV with, but it was also a mobile 
            gaming device, similar to that of the Nintendo Gameboy and Nintendo DS. As of December 31, 2022 the Switch has sold over 122 million units, and considering it is one of the newest consoles mentioned on this list, it is likely to increase even further 
            beyond that.
